# The Meteoschweiz Spack Deployment

Official Spack documentation [below](#-spack).

## Building software on tsa

First git clone the Meteoschweiz spack fork and source the spack file under spack/share/spack in order to use it

    $ git clone https://github.com/elsagermann/spack.git
    $ cd spack/share/spack
    $ . setup-env.sh
 
Then activate the environment machine (tsa, daint soon available)

    $ spack env activate <machine>
    
You are then able to build any packages available (_spack list_ to print the whole list of available packages)

    $ spack install <package>@<version>%<compiler> +<variants>
 
Ex:
    
    $ spack install cosmo@master%pgi +gpu
    

This will then git clone the package, build it and then install the chosen package and all its dependencies under /scratch/$USER/install/tsa (see _config.yaml_ file section for details). The build-stage of your package and its dependencies are not kept Module files are also created during this process and install under /scratch/$USER/modules/.

## Dev-building software on tsa

If you do not want to git clone the source of the package you want to install, especially if you are developing, you can use a local source in order to install your package. In order to do so, first go to the base directory of the package and then use spack _dev-build_ instead of spack install 
    
    $ cd <package_base_directory>
    $ spack _dev-build_ <package>@<version>%<compiler> +<variants>
    
The package, its dependencies and its modules will be still installed under /scratch/$USER/install/tsa & /scratch/$USER/modules/
      
## Spack info

Use the spack command

    $ spack info <package>
    
in order to get a list of all possible building configuration available such as: version available, list of dependencies and variants. Variants are a key-feature of spack since it tells it which build configuration we want (i.e COSMO with target gpu or cpu)

## Spack edit

Use the spack command

    $ spack edit <package>

in order to open the correspondig _package.py_ file and edit it directly

## Machine specific config files

Are available under _spack/var/spack/environements/`<machine>`_. Their structure is:
 
<ul>
    <li>spack.yaml (spack environment file, describes the set of packages to be installed, and includes the below machine config files)</li>
    <li>config:</li>
        <ul>
            <li>
	    -compilers.yaml (all info about available compilers, machine specific compiler flags, module to load (PrgEnv) before compiling)</li>
            <li>-packages.yaml (all info about the already installed dependencies, i.e their module names or paths)</li>
            <li>-modules.yaml (all info about the created modules, i.e which env variable or modules should be set once loaded)</li>
            <li>-config.yaml (specifies the main installation path and the main module installation path, where to find the binaries etc.)</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
</ul>


Documentation
----------------

[**Full documentation**](http://spack.readthedocs.io/) is available, or
run `spack help` or `spack help --all`.

Tutorial
----------------

We maintain a
[**hands-on tutorial**](http://spack.readthedocs.io/en/latest/tutorial.html).
It covers basic to advanced usage, packaging, developer features, and large HPC
deployments.  You can do all of the exercises on your own laptop using a
Docker container.

Feel free to use these materials to teach users at your organization
about Spack.

Community
------------------------

Spack is an open source project.  Questions, discussion, and
contributions are welcome. Contributions can be anything from new
packages to bugfixes, documentation, or even new core features.

Contributing
------------------------
Contributing to Spack is relatively easy.  Just send us a
[pull request](https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests/).
When you send your request, make ``develop`` the destination branch on the
[Spack repository](https://github.com/spack/spack).

Your PR must pass Spack's unit tests and documentation tests, and must be
[PEP 8](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/) compliant.  We enforce
these guidelines with [Travis CI](https://travis-ci.org/spack/spack).  To
run these tests locally, and for helpful tips on git, see our
[Contribution Guide](http://spack.readthedocs.io/en/latest/contribution_guide.html).

Spack uses a rough approximation of the
[Git Flow](http://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/)
branching model.  The ``develop`` branch contains the latest
contributions, and ``master`` is always tagged and points to the latest
stable release.
